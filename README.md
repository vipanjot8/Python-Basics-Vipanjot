Beginner Python exercises from my learning journey (FreeCodeCamp + self-practice)
# Python Basics – Day 1 Practice
This repository contains beginner-level Python exercises I'm working on as part of my learning journey. I'm currently learning Python using the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) course and solving small practice problems daily to build my skills step-by-step.

## 📁 File Included

- **`day1_python_practice.py`**  
  A collection of small Python programs that use:
  - User input
  - String manipulation
  - Basic math operations
  - String slicing
  - Conditional logic (`if/else`)
    
## ✅ Concepts Practiced on Day 1:

- Collecting user input with `input()`
- Performing arithmetic using `float()` for decimals
- Creating a simple calculator
- Reversing strings using slicing
- Working with string concatenation
- Measuring string length with `len()`
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Writing readable and interactive output

## 📚 Example Exercises:
- Personalized welcome message
- Age converter (years → months)
- Reverse a sentence
- Sentence length checker
- Mini calculator (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide)

## 📌 Next Steps:
This is just Day 1 — I'll be uploading more files and real-world beginner projects as I continue learning.
